# About Sammi the Cocker Spaniel - aka Sammi Trailer

* She is 16 years old, and has had a pretty sad life.  She is now completely deaf.  

* For the first 14 years, she spent her days and nights locked in a laundry, alone, and only let out into the garden for a small part of the day.  And for the last 2 years, she was living in a crate in an apartment.  

* She was very skinny (when I got her) - her backbone and ribs are sticking right out.  She walks funny.  

* She was not toilet trained at all (when I got her) - she basically pees and poos wherever she feels like it: inside, outside, she don't care.  

* On 13-Sep-2022 I adopted her and gave her a *Forever Home* so that the last years of her life will be happy and free.  

* I'm teaching her about Cat Flaps, toilet training her, giving her plenty of love and attention and food, and helping her wheever I can.  

* She will never be lonely or left on her own again - when I am at work, my best friend - a dog sitter - minds her.

* She has 24 hour, unrestricted access to a large, fully fenced, safe lawn area.

* She has 100 acres of land to explore - tons of walking trails.

* She also has other friends: Patty Cakes, 2 cats, and a bunch of chooks.

*  On 13-Sep-2022, she was adopted by Moose OMalley: https://github.com/MooseValley/Moose-OMalley
