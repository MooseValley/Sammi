# About Sammi the Cocker Spaniel - aka Sammi Trailer
!(Sammi.jpg?raw=true "Sammi")

* She is 16 years old and completely deaf.  

* On 13-Sep-2022 I adopted her and gave her a *Forever Home* so that the last years of her life will be as happy and free as possible.  

* I'm teaching her about Cat Flaps, giving her plenty of love and attention and food, and helping her whenever I can.  

* She will never be lonely or left on her own. When I am at work, my best friend - a dog sitter - minds her.

* She has 24/7 hour unrestricted access to a large, fully fenced, safe lawn area.

* She has lots of walking trails to explore with me.

* She also has other friends: Patty Cakes, 2 cats (Sneaky Cat - aka K-OS, and Friendly Cat - aka D-Struction), and a bunch of chooks.  More to come soon ...

*  On 13-Sep-2022, she was adopted by Moose OMalley: https://github.com/MooseValley/Moose-OMalley
